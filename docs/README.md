## Our Game

Area 52 is an Open-World Zombie Apocalypse Survival where you will have to manage your resources and fight
through the world's end to find a cure. This isometric new experience has everything you need from a game.
A main story, multiple enemies, a engaging turn-based combat system and plenty of items to pick up around
the map.
